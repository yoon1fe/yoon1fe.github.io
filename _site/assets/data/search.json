First, reference toc.js in templates where you would like to add the table of content. Then, create an HTML element wherever you want your table of contents to appear:\n\n&amp;lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n\n\nThen you put your post with titles and all like:\n\n## Title\n## Mid title 1\nThis is text on page one\n## Mid title 2\nThis is text for page two\n### Sub title 2.a\nSome more text\n\n\nThen at the end of your post, you call the .toc() function using:\n\n&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    $(&#39;#toc&#39;).toc();\n});\n&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;\n\n\nHow it would look like\n\nSo you can get a feel of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
